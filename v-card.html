            <li>My curiosity is endless. I try to get new skills everyday in many fields to improve myself. </li>
            <li>I adapt myself to environements where i'm going to. That's for me the best way to be understood by others and to communicate with others. So I have eases to get in contact with everybody. I'm not waiting for anything in return, just some sharing. </li>
            <li>I can take the lead at any moment, giving responsabilities, getting understood by others. I never forget how to lead my life. </li>
            <li>The way I live and I observe things gives me opportunities to see the little invisible things in many situations, picking up the best of those ones to build something.</li>
